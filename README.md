# ProtractorUITestAutomation
Test Automation Framework and project using Protractor with Typescript

#Setup Instructions
#1 Install Visual Studio Code editor - Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity). 

To install - Navigate to https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Click download button
- Download the VSCode software oacjage according to your operating system, and install it
- Launch Visual Studio Code to esure that it is successfully installed

#2 Installing Node.js: Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.  WebDriverJS has been written in Node.js and Protractor is written on top of WebDriverJS. So, you need NodeJS to enable compilation for Protractor.
To install - Navigate to : https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Download the package according to your operating system, and install it.
- After the installation is complete, open command prompt and type 'node' and press enter key.  If command prompt does not show any error, then NodeJS has been installed successfully.

#3 Installing Protractor: Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.
To Install - You can install Protractor from the Visual Studio Code itself.
- Launch Visual Studio Code, and click on View -> Integrated Terminal (From top navigation links)
- Type following command, and press enter
npm install protractor -g

#4 Installing Typescript: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features.  Typescript adopts the basic building blocks of your program from JavaScript. Hence, you only need to know JavaScript to use TypeScript. All TypeScript code is converted into its JavaScript equivalent for the purpose of execution.
To Install - You can install Typescript from the Visual Studio Code itself. (Continuation from Install step #3)
- Type following command, and press enter
npm install typescript -g

#5 Installing Jasmine: Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.
To Install - You can install Jasmine from the Visual Studio Code itself. (Continuation from Install step #3)
- Type following command, and press enter
npm install jasmine
